// Algorithm - a PROCESS or a SET OF STEPS to accomplish a certain task

//* PROBLEM SOLVING //

  //* 1.Understand the problem
    // Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    // What are the inputs that go into the problem
    // What are the outputs that should come from the solution
    // Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words,
      // do I have enough info to solve the problem?
    // How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem

  //* 2 Exploring concrete examples
    // Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    // Start with simple examples
    // Progress to more complex examples
    // Explore examples with empty inputs
    // Explore examples with invalid inputs

  //* 3. Break it down
    // Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

  //* 4 Solve/Simplify
